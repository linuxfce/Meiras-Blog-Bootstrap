### Theresa May dined with Presidents Club co-chair after sleaze scandal

Bruce Ritchie met PM after she criticised charity’s men-only event where female staff alleged sexual harassment

Theresa May had dinner with the co-chair of the controversial Presidents Club only weeks after she had criticised the charity’s event at which female staff were allegedly propositioned for sex, new records show.

Bruce Ritchie donated at least £50,000 to the Conservatives’ Leader’s Group (CLG), which secures members exclusive access to May at dinners, lunches and meetings after prime minister’s question time.

Allegations about the Presidents Club dinner at the Dorchester hotel emerged last January after an undercover investigation by journalists from the Financial Times found that women working at the event were allegedly groped and invited by diners to join them in bedrooms at the hotel.

One worker said: “The most shocking thing for me was the afterparty … A lot of hands were up skirts, I saw a lot of grabbing.”

Ritchie, the founder of Residential Land, was at the centre of criticism after it emerged that young women were asked to wear skimpy black clothes and sign non-disclosure agreements for the men-only event.

The prime minister was among those who called for such events to be halted, saying: “I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past, that we had managed to overcome.”

The charitable activity of the Presidents Club was halted after the revelations. In July, trustees such as Ritchie were found to be acting in good faith and for the best interests of the charity, but were also heavily criticised by the charity commission for failing to protect the reputation of the charity or the welfare of female workers.

Trustees rebutted the allegations of harassment and responded by saying they had not received any complaints from female staff. Despite a callout for evidence, no individual complainants came forward to assist the commission with its investigation.

Ritchie has refused to confirm whether he attended the annual dinner and he did not respond to a request for comment. Following publication, Ritchie contacted the Guardian through his solicitors to deny any wrongdoing.

He was one of 48 benefactors who socialised with the prime minister between 1 April and 30 June last year, with others including businesspeople who support a hard Brexit and a number of oil executives. In total, donations to the CLG amounted to £2.4m.

The identities of CLG members who dined with May have been uploaded to the Conservative party’s website.

Since 2013, the party has provided a limited glimpse of its elite donor events by publishing a list of donor and cabinet minister attendees four times a year.
